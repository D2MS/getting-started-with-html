  <!-- Below this is a <title> element. You may be wondering why "Andy's Notes" doesn't actually show up anywhere on the page. The reason is that <title> elements are actually what tell the browser what text to put on the tab for your page so that users can find it when they have many tabs open. This title is actually being ignored in this tab (instead the title is "A Pen by Andy Brown"), but I wanted to include it anyway. -->
  <title>Alejandro's Notes</title>
  <!-- Below this is a <link> tag. It isn't doing anything in Codepen (since Codepen automatically links whatever is in the "CSS" box), but it WOULD be necessary if I were using a text editor like Sublime and trying to open this HTML file in my browser. 
 
  NOTE: you will need to include a <link> to your CSS file when you submit your project for evalution. -->

	•	Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&#60p> for example) and a closing tag, (&#60/p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &#60br> tag).
<br><br>	•	Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br><br>
	•	Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &#60a href="www.udacity.com">
